# Design pattern: Observer
## Requirements
Congratulations! You have been selected to build our latest generation online weather station!

The station will be based on our patent-pending WeatherData object, which records weather conditions at a given time (temperature, humidity and air pressure). 

We would like you to create an application that will initially provide three displays: 
* current conditions
* statistics 
* and a simple forecast

all three updated in real time as the WeatherData object acquires the most recent data.

In addition, this weather station must be scalable. WeatherExpress wants to release an API so that other developers can make their own displays and insert them directly. 

We would like you to provide this API!
