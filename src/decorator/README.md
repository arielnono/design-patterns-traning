## Requirements
Starbuzz Coffee has made a name for itself as the largest "coffee lounge" chain.

The goal is to deliver coffee beverage

* There are many types of coffee: espresso, capuccino, Sumatra, decaffeinated

* In addition to coffee, one can also request several ingredients such as milk foam, caramel, chocolate, vanilla or hazelnut syrup and top it off with whipped cream. Starbuzz charges for each of these extras, so they really need to incorporate them into their ordering system.
